        <p>
            I was born in the parish of Kingston, Jamaica. I was the 9th of 16 siblings. I grew up in a small community called Cassava Piece where I was a young role model to others.
            At the age of 12, I formed a youth organization for the younger children of the community. People young and old were motivated by my work ethic.
            I would feed the kids, give them shelter if needed, and speak with them if they needed someone to talk to. I am a Pastor, entrepreneur
            and CEO of a nonprofit organization, a wife, and a mother of 3 children and an adopted child, all while serving as a humanitarian and philanthropist.
            I remain calm under pressure and can handle anything thrown at me. I am greatly respected in my community for my willing heart and my desire
            to share not only my time but also the Word of God.
